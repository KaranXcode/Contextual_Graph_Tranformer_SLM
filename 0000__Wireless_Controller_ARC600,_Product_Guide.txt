Wireless Controller ARC600 is a compact, solution based
device for remote controlling and monitoring of secondary
substations, such as network disconnectors, load break
switches and ring main units (RMU) in distribution networks. It
enables the SCADA system to wirelessly monitor and control
the field devices over the public communication infrastructure
(cellular network). Wireless Controller ARC600 utilizes the
built-in wireless communication features for reliable and
secure end-to-end communication providing remote
monitoring and control of three switching devices and can be
expanded as required by using external I/O expansion
The use of Wireless Controller ARC600 in distribution
networks improves the quality of power distribution and
reduces the outage time in the affected areas. Areas directly
adjacent to these affected areas show reduced outages and
overall effects. This also reduces the capital expenditures in
the distribution network by allowing integration of legacy
devices and contributes to more direct cost savings by
facilitating preventative maintenance. The operational
expenditure can be reduced by lowering the System Average
Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) and System Average
Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), resulting in lower
penalties for undelivered energy. Wireless Controller ARC600
is also ideally suited to be retrofitted to existing applications
thus enabling the remote control of these devices and further
extending the life cycle of the switching devices itself.
Typically, the IEC-104 protocol is utilized for communication
to the SCADA system but for the existing installations with a
IEC-101 line or modem, Wireless Controller ARC600 supports
also IEC-101 communication (including dial-up) to the SCADA

Within the UEMC control cabinet, the ARC600 unit is used for the remote control of a disconnector. The motor operating device is
fitted to the disconnector.
4. Battery condition monitoring
Wireless Controller ARC600 is equipped with a condition
monitoring based battery charger. This allows scheduled
monitoring of the backup batteries inside the control cabinet
which enables the optimization of lifetime and maintenance
intervals of the backup batteries. The backup battery can be
either manually or periodically tested by switching off the
charger and switching on the external dummy load.
Manual testing can be initiated from a central control system
via the IEC-104 protocol. Based on the current and voltage
measurements taken from the battery, an assessment is
made regarding the battery’s condition and remaining
operational capacity (in Ah). Based on these measurements of
the battery’s current and voltage levels, an IEC 60870-5-104
alarm event is then generated in the system.
ARC600 has also protection against complete battery
5. Motor overload protection
Wireless Controller ARC600 protects the disconnector motor
by using overcurrent detection. The current of the
disconnector motor is continuously measured and if the
preset value is exceeded, the current supply to the motor is
cut. The preset current value should be set so that the
current supply to the motor is cut before the motor protection
fuse opens the circuit. This leads to less site visits to reset
the fuse. Typically, rust or ice might cause the disconnector
blades to get stuck in the closed position, resulting in either
damage to the disconnector motor due to overcurrent or
operation of the protection fuse.

Wireless Controller ARC600 provides a complete solution for
monitoring and controlling field devices. A secure
communication channel can be formed for remote serial
(RS-232/RS-485) or Ethernet field devices over a GPRS, 3G
or LTE connection. ARC600 makes it possible to have cost-
effective communication networks over long distances at high
Several interfaces are available for field device connectivity:
digital inputs and outputs, analog inputs, serial and Ethernet
ports. Industrial protocols IEC-104, IEC-101 and Modbus
TCP are supported for the SCADA connectivity. The inputs
and outputs of ARC600 can be accessed and controlled with
the IEC-104 and IEC-101 protocols.
With the Wireless Controller ARC600 protocol conversion
feature, conventional IEC-101, Modbus RTU and Modbus
TCP devices can be connected in a reliable way to modern
TCP/IP based IEC-104 control systems.
Modbus to IEC-104 conversion
ARC600 provides support for generic Modbus RTU and
Modbus TCP devices such as ABB's RIO600. In addition,
support is also provided for the preselected Modbus
parameters for Fault Passage Indicators (FPI). Currently,
Horstmann Compass B and Kries IKI-50 are supported.
ARC600 polls the fault indicator devices, connected to the
serial port, using Modbus protocol and converts the values to
IEC 60870-5-104. Up to four fault indicators can be
connected to one device. IEC 60870-5-104 is used to
communicate towards a SCADA via the Arctic M2M Gateway
over the available customer chosen cellular data network.
IEC-101 to IEC-104 conversion
With ARC600, conventional IEC 60870-101 serial devices can
be attached to a modern TCP/IP based IEC 60870-5-104
control system. This is enabled by the protocol conversion
ARC600 (IEC-101 master) uses local synchronous data
polling where it continuously sends requests and the IEC-101
device (IEC-101 slave) responds. In the direction of the
control room, the communication protocol is IEC-104 and
ARC600 can send events asynchronously as they arise while
SCADA performs only slow-period background scans.
Another advantage of the local protocol conversion is an
advanced data acknowledgement mechanism. IEC-104
allows multiple packets, and multiple events in a single
packet, to be acknowledged collectively and the packets can
be buffered up to the time of acknowledgement from SCADA.
Modbus RTU to Modbus conversion
Modbus field devices use usually serial mode (RTU or ASCII)
protocol while the SCADA communication uses TCP/IP based
Modbus TCP protocol. The Modbus user community has
defined the functionality for required protocol integration, that
is, how the Modbus RTU devices can talk to the Modbus TCP
SCADA system. This functionality is a protocol conversion
and it is implemented in ARC600. Many industrial devices like
PLCs and RTUs support RS-485 Modbus RTU mode. In
RS-485 mode, ARC600 can integrate unlimited number of
serial slaves to TCP/IP network (SCADA).
ARC600 has two application serial ports. Serial port 1 is
configurable to either console or data mode and it supports
only RS-232, while serial port 2 is configurable to multiple
serial modes (RS-232/RS-422/RS-485). Serial port
connectors are 9-pin D-sub (male) connectors. More

The devices have been equipped with mounting arrangements
that are specially designed for DIN rail mounting. A set of DIN
rail mounting clips is recommended to be used when mounting.
The device should be mounted preferably inside a robust,
locked and weatherproof control cabinet.
As the device uses a cellular radio for data transmission, the
surrounding environment can negatively affect the efficacy of
these radio signals. Therefore, if a device with the antenna is
mounted on the antenna connector, the unit should not be
placed in a location where the radio signal might be shadowed,
and therefore deteriorated by nearby obstacles or enclosures.
The large metallic surfaces, racks or walls with metallic
structures (cabling, concrete iron, and so on) may degrade the
antenna performance to a very high extent. In this case, it is
highly recommended to use the optional external antenna with
appropriate cable. This allows for better positioning of the
devices, antennas and thus optimal performance.
Another restriction to the positioning of the device during
installation is that it should be mounted in such a way that the
required environmental conditions that are set in the Technical
data section of this product guide are met.
The product label contains basic information about the unit
such as product name, serial number and Ethernet MAC
The product label is found at the bottom of the device.
